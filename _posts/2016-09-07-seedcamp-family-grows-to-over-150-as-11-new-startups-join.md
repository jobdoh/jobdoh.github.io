Seedcamp Family Grows to Over 150 as 11 New Startups Join

We’re excited to announce our investment in the following startups who attended Seedcamp Week London. They’ll be joining the Seedcamp family as of next week – congratulations, guys!

It means we’ve now invested in over 150 startups since 2007. We couldn’t be more thrilled. We’ve watched the European startup ecosystem grow over the last few years and it’s been incredibly exciting to see the quality of Seedcamp Week applications improve year after year. A big part of it is due to our amazing network of investors and mentors who give their time helping companies from around Europe, so we’d like to extend a big “thank you” to them!

Well, we’ve been keeping it quiet, but we’re also finally able to share the exciting news that Gamewheel did indeed join us and has been working in stealth for the last few months:
