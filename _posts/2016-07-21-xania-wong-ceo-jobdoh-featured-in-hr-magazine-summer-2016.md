Local HR Tech Startups Disrupting Hong Kong's Talent Acquisition Market

JOBDOH interviewed alongside another disriptive HR startup founder, Max Armbruster from Talkpush, sharing why and how we are transforming the traditional HR recruitment industry.

Who we are:
JOBDOH is an award winning smart-hiring platform that connects employers with on-demand and temporary workers quickly. Featured by major press and media such as CNBC, we reduce the inefficiency of searching and matching candidates. Our platform is 95X faster than the market average in fulfilling jobs, setting a record from job posting to arrival to under 75 minutes. While our proprietary algorithm enables clients to receive the most suitable candidates, candidates benefit from an increased flexibility to earn extra income quickly as well as an improved upward mobility through the transparent record keeping system.

Whether you represent an international business on short assignments in Asia or you already have an established business here, JOBDOH is your optimal staffing solution. 

Why we exist:
"I created the company to transform the way people work and live. By using data to make the temporary staffing process more efficient and effective, both employers and candidates get faster, better results, and more flexible arrangements." - Founder and CEO Xania Wong
