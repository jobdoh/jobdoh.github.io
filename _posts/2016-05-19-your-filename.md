## Having fun at OnSummit :)
  
  
  
  

This weekend, we hopped onto OnSummit – A startup pitching organised by the HKU Alumni Entrepreneurs Club. We had a lot of fun meeting you guys, and exchanging ideas. Also, it was great to listen to Dr. Allan Zeman’s, the founder of Lan Kwai Fong, inspiring speech on what makes a startup successful.

Thank you for all your support at Onsummit! Special thanks to the HKU Alumni Entrepreneurs Club for giving JOBDOH an opportunity to inspire people on stage.
