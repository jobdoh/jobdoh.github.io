With world class convention facilities such as the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Center (HKCEC), Hong Kong hosts more than 100 exhibitions a year. If your are exporting internationally, chances are you will have a chance to visit Hong Kong eventually. Here are ten places you can visit if you can spare some time from the trade show to explore the city.

1. Big Buddha

   Whether you are spiritual or not, this posts as a good viewpoint of HK. Depends on how much time and energy you have, you may hike up, take the Ngong Ping 360 cable car or taxi up.

2. Tai O Village

   A great day-trip away from the buzzing city.

3. Temple Street Night Market

   Snacking on local eats, shopping for cheap souvenirs, getting your fortune told/ palms read, or just feeling the density of the crowd, you will find this area either dynamic or intimidating.

4. Lan Kwai Fong

   Want to take your buyers out to help close the deal? This area has some of the hottest bars and restaurants in HK.

5. Lamma Island

   If you have a better half of a day, you can take the ferry to the Lamma Island. Hike from one end to the other, snack on traditional treats along the way and finish the day with a sumptuous seafood dinner before boating back to the island.

6. Victoria Peak

   Take the peak tram to get a fabulous view of HK. Best time to go is early evening so you can catch all of the day, sunset and evening view in one.

7. Happy Valley Horse Racecourse

   Taking place every Wednesday, this is a fun way to bond with your potential clients and maybe win some cash.

8. Clock Tower and Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade

   Just in time after you finish your busy day at the trade fair, head here to catch the daily light show at 8pm.

9. Star ferry ride

   After the light show at the Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade, take the iconic star ferry to cross the harbour and back to the HK Island side.

10. PMQ

   Converted from the Queen’s College and Police Married Quarters, this site show cases the emerging creative talents. A good place for souvenir shopping or idea generation for designs or gifts and premiums.
