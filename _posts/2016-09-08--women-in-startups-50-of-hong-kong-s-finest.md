title: ' Women in Startups — 50+ of Hong Kong’s finest!'
---
2 weeks ago I wrote a Guide to the Hong Kong Startup Community. I’m glad to say that the piece was well received by many and has since appeared in various other publications across the web. The article is structured in a 5x5 format — listing 5 each of accelerators/incubators, coworking spaces, startups, startup events and entrepreneurs.

As I sat down to review it last week, I realised that I listed only 1 woman among the 5 entrepreneurs. And I feel that that is a misrepresentation, on my part. Because there are just so many more here in HK — women who’re actively and significantly contributing to the startup community!

According to BNP Paribas’ “Global Entrepreneurialism Report” (survey of 2,523 entrepreneurs in 17 markets), 37 per cent of entrepreneurs across the globe are women. In Hong Kong, that figure rises to 45% — awesome! It is second only to India where 49 per cent of entrepreneurs are female (I’m proud of that statistic too!).

_Hong Kong ranks second in the world when it comes to women setting up their own businesses — 45% of entrepreneurs are women!_

I am a feminist, and sincerely believe women can make the greatest difference to most of this world’s greatest problems. Inspired by the 3 women in my life (mother, wife, sister) who attempt to do so every single day, in their own way.

So, I thought I should create a list of women who are entrepreneurs, investors or essaying other varied roles in Hong Kong’s startup world. These individuals are building awesome products/teams in sectors as varied as education, events, travel, coworking spaces, accelerators, startup platforms, social analytics and so much more!

_My disclaimers from the previous post remain:
1. This is not an exhaustive list!
2. It is in no particular order._

**[Catherine Tan](http://twitter.com/cathnotey) (Notey)**

(the 1 name I had in the earlier piece) An ex-investment banker at Morgan Stanley and Barclays, Catherine is the cofounder of Notey, a platform for discovering blogs. She splits her time between Hong Kong, Vancouver and travelling the world. Business Insider listed Notey as ‘one of the 15 fastest growing startups in the world, that you don’t know of’.

**[Michelle Sun](https://twitter.com/michellelsun) (FirstCode)**

When a Growth professional (ex-Buffer, Bump) quits to found a startup that teaches children how to code, you have to sit up and take notice. That is exactly what Michelle did, in 2013. Though Hong Kong-born, she gained vital experience working with tech startups in the Valley and has brought all that to bear here.

**[Michelle Lam](http://twitter.com/michellelam) (Spoilt)**

Michelle pitched Spoilt at Startup Saturday back in 2011 (the event itself is considered a seminal milestone in HK startups). Spoilt deals in experiences, gifts for you and me, and a whole range of bespoke articles/activities for corporates. In 2014, Spoilt acquired their largest competitior RedPacket and now operates both brands.

**[Maura Thompson](http://twitter.com/sassyhongkong) (Sassy Media Group)**

Maura Thompson moved to Hong Kong, wanted to make friends (and find awesome deals), so she started Sassy in 2009! A specialist in data and analytics, she growth-hacked her startup, before the word was THE buzz it is today. Maura juggles work with being a doting mama to her daughter Eve (See: Instagram).

The latter is an online marketplace where travellers get perks for working at service establishments, and was one of 6 startups selected for the Google EYE (Empowering Young Entrepreneurs) program.
