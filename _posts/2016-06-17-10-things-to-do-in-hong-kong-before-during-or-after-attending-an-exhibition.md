With world class convention facilities such as the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Center (HKCEC), Hong Kong hosts more than 100 exhibitions a year. If your are exporting internationally, chances are you will have a chance to visit Hong Kong eventually. Here are ten places you can visit if you can spare some time from the trade show to explore the city.

1. Big Buddha
Whether you are spiritual or not, this posts as a good viewpoint of HK. Depends on how much time and energy you have, you may hike up, take the Ngong Ping 360 cable car or taxi up.

2. Tai O Village
A great day-trip away from the buzzing city.
