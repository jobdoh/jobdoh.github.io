THE QUICK FIX TO TALENT SHORTAGE

Facing the challenge of an ageing workforce, hiring only full-time permanent workers is no longer sufficient to meet business needs.  Employers need to look for other talent sources to meet their manpower demands. With JOBDOH, a mobile-first online job portal, employers can easily reach out to talents such as students, housewives and retirees.

Through the powerful JOBDOH AI system which tops industry standards, the amount of time employers save in screening candidates is un-precedent. Spare 30 minutes for a demo and you will see how JOBDOH technology can add turbo to recruitment efficiency. The JOBDOH screening system gives candidates a score based on 15 areas. Employers can locate the most suitable candidates based on the score without having to meet them face to face.

If employers want to find out more about the candidate, they can conduct a video conference interview through the app. After every project, employers will give a rating to the employee. Employers can see the rating and past employment history of candidates to help them make informed hiring decisions.

The questions that JOBDOH ask candidates in the screening process are based on proven psychology. Knowing that candidates with the best qualifications doesn’t necessarily mean they are the best employees, the questions focus on the attitude and eagerness of candidates.

The efficiency of JOBDOH is another factor that impresses users. The system is able to help employers find the right
match in three minutes.  There are cases where staff showed up for work an hour after the job advertisement was put up.  All of this is made possible with the advanced AI of JOBDOH.

Looking forward, I think using AI to select the most suitable candidates is an integral part of recruitment in the future. Not only does it save time with interviews, it also eliminates human bias in the selection process.


發掘人才快的速辦法

面對勞動力老化的挑戰,只聘用全職長期員工不再足以滿足業務需求。僱主需要發掘其他人才來源,以滿足他們的人力需求。

JOBDOH是一個以流動用戶為目標的招聘網站, 透過幫助僱主接觸潛在人才,如學生、家庭主婦及退休人士,以滿足僱主的人才需求。

JOBDOH較其他招聘應用程式優勝之處在於透過其其強大的人工智能系統,可以大量減省僱主用於面試的時間。你只需花三十分鐘的時間就能體驗JOBDOH的高科技如何快速篩選應徵者。

JOBDOH篩選系統按15個範疇為應徵者評分,僱主可根據評分來尋找最合適的人選,不必與應徵者面試。如果僱主想對候選人了解更多,他們可以通過應用程式進行視像面試。每個項目完成後,僱主會為員工作出評級。

僱主可以查看應聘者的評級及過往工作經歷,以幫助他們作出明智的聘用決定。

JOBDOH會在篩選過程中向應徵者提出相關的心理測驗問題。資歷最佳的候選人並不一定是最優秀的員工,因此問題集中在候選人的態度及期望。

JOBDOH的系統能夠幫助僱主在三分鐘內找到合適的候選人,其效率是令用戶垂青的另一個因素。曾經試過有員工在招聘廣告刊載一小時後立刻上班。

JOBDOH人工智能系統令一切變得可能。

展望未來,我認為透過人工智能系統來選擇最合適的候選人,不僅節省面試時間,亦減少篩選過程中的人為偏見,是未來招聘過程的一個重要環節。
