1.  **Service Connects Taskers and Clients**

    The Service is a communications platform which enables the connection between Clients and Taskers. Clients are individuals and/or businesses seeking to obtain task services (“Tasks”) from Taskers and are therefore clients of Taskers, and Taskers are individuals and/or businesses seeking to perform Tasks (“Taskers”) for Clients. Clients and Taskers together are hereinafter referred to as “Users.”

    Service Only Provides a Venue

    The Service is a platform for enabling connections between Users for the fulfillment of Tasks, but Company is not responsible for the performance of Users, nor does it have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of Tasks Clients, nor of the integrity, responsibility or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Users. Company does not have control over the quality, timing or legality of Tasks delivered by its Taskers. Company makes no representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of the Tasks requested and provided by Users identified through the Service whether in public, private, or offline interactions.

2.  **User Vetting**

    Clients and Taskers may be subject to an extensive vetting process before they can register and during their use of the Service, including but not limited to a verification of identity and a comprehensive criminal and bankruptcy/ solvency background check, at the Country, State/province (where applicable) and local level, using third party services as appropriate. Users hereby give consent to Company to conduct background checks as often as required in compliance with laws within the governing jurisdiction.

    Although Company may perform background checks of Users, as outlined above, Company cannot confirm that each User is who they claim to be and therefore, Company cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability identity or background check information or any information provided through the Service.

    When interacting with other Users, you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety and property, just as you would when interacting with other persons whom you don’t know. NEITHER COMPANY NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICE AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATED THERETO. COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.

3.  **Billing and Payment**

    Users of the Service contract for Tasks directly with other Users. Company will not be a party to any contracts for Tasks or services.

    Users of the Service will be required to provide their credit card or bank account details to Company and the Payment Service Provider retained by Company (the “PSP”).

    Clients will be responsible for paying the invoice for each Task (the “Invoice”), which will include the pricing terms of the Task agreed with and provided by a Tasker (“Task Payment”), any out of pocket expenses agreed with and submitted by a Tasker in connection with the Task, any tip or gratuity, if applicable, and the fee ("Service Fee") the Company assesses for the Service, based on the Task Payment amount.

    Taskers may be required to provide bank account details to Company. Or they may be required to register with the PSP, agree to Terms of Service of the PSP and go through a vetting process at the request of the PSP to set up their account with the PSP. Terms of Service between Taskers and the PSP retained by Company are available here (the “PSP Agreement”). By accepting these Terms of Use, each Tasker agrees that they have downloaded or printed, and reviewed and agreed to the PSP Agreement. Please note that the Company is not a party to the PSP Agreement and that you, the PSP and any other parties listed in the PSP Agreement are the parties to the PSP Agreement and that the Company has no obligations or liability to any Tasker under the PSP Agreement.

    Within 24 hours after Client receives confirmation through the Service or via email that a Task has been completed, Client authorizes Company to i) provide Client's payment details to the PSP for processing or ii) invoice Client via email of any fees owed to Company for the use of the Service, and if applicable, Task Payment, out of pocket expenses owed to Tasker, and any tip or gratuity. You may be charged a cancellation fee if you book a Task, but cancel it before it is completed, as set forth in the Task pricing terms.

    Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion (but not the obligation), to (i) place on hold any Task Payment and out of pocket expenses, or (ii) refund, provide credits or arrange for the PSP to do so.

    Clients will be liable for any taxes (including VAT, if applicable) required to be paid on the Services provided under the Agreement (other than taxes on the Company’s income).

    By using the Service, Client acknowledges that Taskers referred to Client under this agreement are referred in relation to any - short term, part-time, contract, consultative or any basis of employment - Tasks. Should Client decide to hire any Taskers introduced under the Terms of this agreement - on a part-time, contract, consultative or any basis of employment separate from this original permanent arrangement – Client will be liable to pay the relevant agency fee, as shown on the Platform.

    In the event Client offers other Tasks or employment - on any basis - within 12 months of Tasker introduction through Company, Client shall pay Company the relevant Service Fee. The Agreement is that Company’s Service Fee will apply to any Taskers, initiated, referred or listed by Company for a specific Task, or any alternate Tasks or employment opportunities (contracted or permanent) offered and employed by Client or a subsidiary, affiliate, or related company, within this timeframe, whether in the capacity of a Tasker or an employee. The introduction effected by Company to Client is confidential and is not for referral to any outside third party not legally associated with Client.

    Any interview of Taskers referred by Company is deemed as acceptance of Company’s standard Terms of Business.

    Regardless of the length of the Task Duration, the calculation of the Conversion Fee from temporary to permanent (12% of total annual remuneration) is based on 12-months remuneration. Please note that any Tasker presented to, and placed in Client remains a Company Tasker from the date of introduction to Client.

4.  **Release**

    The Service is only a venue for connecting Users. Because Company is not involved in the actual contact between Users or in the completion of the Task, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more Users, you release Company (and our officers, directors, agents, investors, subsidiaries, and employees) from any and all claims, demands, or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
